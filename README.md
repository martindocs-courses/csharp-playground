# CSharp Playground

Welcome to the **CSharp Playground** repository!
This space is dedicated to exploring C# through theory, code snippets, and mini-projects. The goal of this repository is to serve as an ever-evolving collection of resources, helping me deepen my understanding of C# concepts while building practical, small-scale programs.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into various categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of C#. Project counts are listed alongside visible categories.

### **Note**

Categories listed here that are **not visible in the repository tree** are under construction, as they currently do not contain any projects. These are planned for future development.

- **APIIntegration**: Small projects or code samples for integrating with third-party APIs.
- **DataAccess**: Code related to databases, file handling, and data storage.
- **EducationalDemos**: Demonstrations of fundamental C# concepts and practices, often used for learning purposes.
- **FileHandling**: Exercises and examples related to file input/output operations.
- **Games**: Fun mini-games or prototypes using C# game development frameworks like Unity.
- **Libraries**: Custom libraries and utility functions that could be reused in different projects.
- **Networking**: Code related to communication protocols, sockets, and web services.
- **Productivity**: Tools and utilities aimed at improving efficiency, such as task managers or automation scripts.
- **Security**: Projects focusing on encryption, secure communication, or other security-related topics in C#.
- **Utilities**: General-purpose utility programs, such as text manipulation, data converters, or system tools.
- **Theory**: Contains markdown files covering important C# concepts. These can include notes, code explanations, and insights into language features.

## Navigate to a category

Each folder contains projects with a prefix specifying their platform (e.g., console, web, desktop) and complexity level (e.g., basic, intermediate).
Example:

```bash
[4 Projects] Utilities/
├── [console-basic] display_email_address/
├── [console-basic] fahrenheit_to_celsius/
...
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
