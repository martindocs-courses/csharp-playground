# CSharp Playground

Welcome to the **CSharp Playground** repository! This space is dedicated to exploring C# through theory, code snippets, and mini projects. The goal of this repository is to be an ever-evolving collection of resources as I dive deeper into C# concepts and build out small programs for practice.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into various folders and files, each focusing on a specific aspect of C#. Hereâ€™s an overview of the structure:

- **APIIntegration**: Small projects or code samples for integrating with third-party APIs.
- **DataAccess**: Code related to databases, file handling, and data storage.
- **EducationalDemos** (9 Projects): Demonstrations of fundamental C# concepts and practices, often used for learning purposes.
- **FileHandling**: Exercises and examples related to file input/output operations.
- **Games** (4 Projects): Fun mini-games or prototypes using C# game development frameworks like Unity.
- **Libraries**: Custom libraries and utility functions that could be reused in different projects.
- **Networking**: Code related to communication protocols, sockets, and web services.
- **Productivity** (1 Project): Tools and utilities aimed at improving efficiency, such as task managers or automation scripts.
- **Security**: Projects focusing on encryption, secure communication, or other security-related topics in C#.
- **Utilities** (4 Projects): General-purpose utility programs, such as text manipulation, data converters, or system tools.
- **Theory**: Contains markdown files covering important C# concepts. These can include notes, code explanations, and insights into language features.
