# CSharp Playground

Welcome to the **CSharp Playground** repository!
This space is dedicated to exploring C# through theory, code snippets, and mini-projects. 
Each project is an opportunity to explore new concepts, solve problems, and refine practical skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into categories based on the type or purpose of the projects. Each category includes projects tagged with platform and complexity details, making it easier to navigate.

### **Categories Overview**

- **APIIntegration**: Projects demonstrating integration with third-party APIs.
- **DataAccess**: Examples of database operations, file handling, and persistent data storage.
- **EducationalDemos**: Demonstrations of fundamental C# concepts and practices, often used for learning purposes.
- **FileHandling**: Exercises and examples related to file input/output operations.
- **Games**: Fun mini-games or prototypes using C# game development frameworks like Unity.
- **Libraries**: Custom reusable libraries for enhancing functionality.
- **Networking**: Code related to communication protocols, sockets, and web services.
- **Productivity**: Tools and utilities aimed at improving efficiency, such as task managers or automation scripts.
- **Security**: Encryption, secure communication, and other security-related projects.
- **Utilities**: General-purpose tools for everyday tasks.
- **Theory**: Files covering important C# concepts. These can include notes, code explanations, and insights into language features.

### **Note**

Some categories may **not visible in the repository tree**. These represent planned future work and are currently under development.

## Transparency and Counting Methodology

Transparency is a key principle in how this repository is structured. Here's how projects are counted and categorized:

### Platform Tags

Each project includes a platform tag in its name to indicate its target platform.
Each folder contains projects with a prefix specifying their platform (e.g., console, web, desktop) and complexity level (e.g., basic, intermediate).

Example project name:
```bash
[2 Project] Utilities/
   ├── [console] calculator/
   │   ├── [basic]/
   │   │   ├── [console-basic] calculator.csproj
   │   │   └── Program.cs
   │   ├── [intermediate]/
   │   │   ├── [console-intermediate] calculator.csproj
   │   │   └── Program.cs
   │   └── [advanced]/
   │       ├── [console-advanced] calculator.csproj
   │       └── Program.cs
   ├── [console] html-extractor/
   │   ...
```

### Counting Projects

Projects are counted based on unique concepts rather than difficulty levels. For instance, if a project has implementations for Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels, it is counted as one unique project in the category total.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martindocs-courses/csharp-playground.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a category**:
   ```bash
   cd csharp-playground/[1 Project] Utilities/
   ```

3. **Run a specific project**:
   Open the desired project folder (e.g., [console] Calculator/Basic/) and build or run it using your preferred C# IDE or the .NET CLI:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
