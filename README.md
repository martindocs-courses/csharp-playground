# CSharp Playground

Welcome to the **CSharp Playground** repository! This space is dedicated to exploring C# through theory, code snippets, and mini projects. The goal of this repository is to be an ever-evolving collection of resources as I dive deeper into C# concepts and build out small programs for practice.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into various folders and files, each focusing on a specific aspect of C#. Hereâ€™s an overview of the structure:

- **Theory**: Contains markdown files covering important C# concepts. These can include notes, code explanations, and insights into language features.
- **ConsoleApps**: Includes small console applications demonstrating specific C# skills and libraries.
- **DesktopApps**: Contains basic desktop application projects.
- **WebApps**: Sample web applications built using C# frameworks.
- **MobileApps**: Mobile application projects (e.g., Xamarin or MAUI) for experimenting with mobile development in C#.
- **Games**: Fun mini-games or prototypes using C# game development frameworks like Unity.
- **Libraries**: Custom libraries and utility functions that could be reused in different projects.
- **DataAccess**: Code related to databases, file handling, and data storage.
- **APIIntegration**: Small projects or code samples for integrating with third-party APIs.
- **FileHandling**: Exercises and examples related to file input/output operations.
