# C# Theory

Welcome to the **Theory** section of the CSharp Playground! This folder is dedicated to theoretical concepts in C# and includes practical examples, code samples, and mini projects to reinforce learning. Each topic is organized into its own subfolder, allowing for a hands-on approach to understanding key C# principles.

## Topics Covered

Here’s an overview of the topics you’ll find in this folder. Each link will take you to a more in-depth `README.md` covering the selected topic, along with relevant code examples and mini projects:

- [Fundamentals](1_Fundamentals/README.md): Basics of C#, including syntax, data types, and control structures, with introductory examples.
<!-- 

- - [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts](OOPConcepts/README.md): Core OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, with sample projects demonstrating each concept.
- [Data Structures](DataStructures/README.md): Common data structures in C# like lists, dictionaries, queues, stacks, and arrays, with examples showing how to use them effectively.
- [Exception Handling](ExceptionHandling/README.md): Guide to handling errors and exceptions gracefully in C#, with sample code for different scenarios.
- [LINQ (Language Integrated Query)](LINQ/README.md): Basics of LINQ, a powerful tool for querying collections and data sources, along with practical examples.
- [Asynchronous Programming](AsyncProgramming/README.md): Introduction to async and await, as well as techniques for building responsive applications, with example tasks to demonstrate asynchronous processing.
- [Delegates and Events](DelegatesAndEvents/README.md): Delegates, events, and their use in event-driven programming, with small projects showcasing how they work in real scenarios.
- [Memory Management and Garbage Collection](MemoryManagement/README.md): Details on how C# handles memory and the garbage collection process, including sample code to illustrate memory handling.
- [File Handling](FileHandling/README.md): Reading from and writing to files in C#, with examples and exercises for file manipulation.
