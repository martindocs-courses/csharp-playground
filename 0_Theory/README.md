Welcome to the Theory section of the CSharp Playground! This folder contains theoretical notes on various C# topics and organizes code samples in dedicated subfolders.

## Theory Notes

The following files contain essential notes on key C# topics:

- **Basics.cs**: Overview of basic C# concepts, including syntax and simple operations.
<!--
- **DataTypes.txt**: Information on different data types in C# and how to use them.
- **ControlStructures.txt**: Explanation of control structures such as loops, conditionals, and more.
-->

*More is coming...* � This section will continue to grow as new topics are added.

## Code Samples

Each subfolder contains example code for hands-on practice related to the corresponding topic:

- **Fundamentals**: Covers the basics of C#, including syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Core OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Data Structures**: Common data structures in C# such as lists, dictionaries, queues, stacks, and arrays.
- **Exception Handling**: A guide to handling errors and exceptions in C#.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Introduction to LINQ for querying collections and data sources.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Basics of async and await, plus techniques for responsive applications.
