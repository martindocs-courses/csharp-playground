# C# Theory

Welcome to the **Theory** section of the CSharp Playground! This folder is dedicated to theoretical concepts in C# and includes practical examples, code snippets, and mini projects to reinforce learning. Each topic is organized into its own subfolder, providing a hands-on approach to understanding key C# principles.

## Topics Covered

Below is an overview of the topics you’ll find in this folder. Each subfolder contains code examples, exercises, and mini projects to deepen your understanding of each concept:

- **Fundamentals**: Covers the basics of C#, including syntax, data types, and control structures, with introductory examples.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Core OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, with sample projects.
- **Data Structures**: Common data structures in C# such as lists, dictionaries, queues, stacks, and arrays, with practical examples.
- **Exception Handling**: A guide to handling errors and exceptions in C#, with sample code for different scenarios.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Introduction to LINQ for querying collections and data sources, with examples to show how it works in practice.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Basics of async and await, plus techniques for responsive applications, with hands-on tasks.
- **Delegates and Events**: Explores delegates, events, and how they’re used in event-driven programming, with small projects to demonstrate real-world use.
- **Memory Management**: Details on how C# handles memory and garbage collection, with sample code for illustrating memory management.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files in C#, with exercises for file manipulation.
